This repository contains data and code associated with the bioinformatics in the article: 

There are three directories, containing data and workflows:

1. targets ------------------------- 

This directory contains two fasta files

marsupialTargets.fa -- these are the targets sequences that were used to design probes for sequence capture
                    -- sequence names begin with the putative Sarcophilus orthologue, followed by sample information for the corresponding transcriptome 

targetExons.fa      -- the target exon sequences, from Sarcophilus only

------------------------------------


2. clean --------------------------- 

perl and shell scripts used to clean illumina sequence reads 

------------------------------------


3. assembly ------------------------

perl and shell scripts used in the assembly of cleaned illumina sequence reads
and the identification and phasing of heterozygous sites

------------------------------------


Scripts are provided here primarily for archival purposes. See also:
